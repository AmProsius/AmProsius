Hi, my name is Fabian and I'm a full stack developer, father and huge nerd.

My favorite stack is [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) + [Stimulus](https://stimulus.hotwired.dev/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) + [Alpine](https://alpinejs.dev/) (TASS). It's similar to Laravel's [TALL stack](https://tallstack.dev/), but with Symfony.

I'm also an Upgrade Specialist. My current areas of expertise are:

- Upgrade Symfony from 4.0 to 6.1
- Upgrade Laravel from 4.2 to 9.x
- Upgrade Bootstrap from 3.0 to 5.2
- Upgrade Tailwind CSS from 1.0 to 3.1
- Migrate Bootstrap (3.0+) to Tailwind CSS 3.1
