Hi, my name is Fabian and I'm a full stack developer, father and autistic.

My current favorite stack is [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

I'm also an Upgrade Specialist. My current areas of expertise are:

- Upgrade Symfony from 4.0 to 7.x
- Upgrade Laravel from 4.2 to 10.x
- Upgrade Bootstrap from 3.0 to 5.x
- Upgrade Tailwind CSS from 1.0 to 3.x
